# Radiant

Radiant is a [Tailwind Plus](https://tailwindcss.com/plus) site template built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). The blog now ships with static sample posts defined in `src/data/blog.js`, so no external CMS credentials are required.

## Getting started

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

To manage your blog content, edit `src/data/blog.js`. You can add, remove, or modify posts directly in the static dataset and redeploy.
